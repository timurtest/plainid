# Plainid Programming Task: 15 Puzzle

Your task is to implement single-user game 15 Puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)
in Java. The 15-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in
random order with one tile missing. The game is represented by 4x4 tiles board where 15
numbered tiles are initially placed in random order and where the 16th tile is missing. A tile can
be moved to a neighbor empty place. To succeed in the game you need to order tiles from 1 to
15, where tile number 1 is at the top left corner and empty one is at the bottom right corner.
**Note: the task is to implement a game, not an algorithm to solve it!**

## Implementation requirements
Make sure to separate handling of presentation, input and game logic. Presentation and input
implemented by simple terminal I/O are good enough. Your solution should be easy to setup up
and run on Linux/MacOS; please use standard build tools from your preferred platform.

## Evaluation
You should value simplicity without sacrificing important design decisions that would allow the
game to be easily maintained and extended in case you are asked to add additional features.
We like interesting solutions but avoid over-engineering. This task has very few requirements on
game representation and play; we encourage you to fill in with your own decisions where
appropriate. Good solutions should take into account:
* Testable design; unit tests and TDD are big pluses but are optional
* Clean code
* Solid knowledge of programming languageâ€™s best practices
* Expressiveness in the design
* Correctness of random initial board generation algorithm implementation
